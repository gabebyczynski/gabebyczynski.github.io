Results from recent clinical trials (TENT-A1 and TENT-A2 studies; clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02669069 and NCT03530306) support that a novel bimodal neuromodulation approach could be a breakthrough treatment for patients with tinnitus, which adversely affects 10â€“15 % of the population. Given the heterogeneity of symptoms, it is important to identify whether treatment has an optimal effect on specific subgroups of tinnitus patients. The current study is a first look at the feasibility of using deep learning modelling on patient reported data to predict treatment outcomes in individuals with tinnitus, and highlights what features are most beneficial for clinical decision making.
