Several studies observed an increase in the area of representation to be associated with improved frequency discrimination. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have been related to the promotion of plasticity. Despite its popularity in other fields, non-invasive brain stimulation has not been used much in auditory perceptual learning. The present review has discussed the application of non-invasive brain stimulation methods in auditory perceptual learning by discussing the mechanisms, current evidence and challenges, and future directions.
