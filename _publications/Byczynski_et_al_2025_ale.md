excerpt: 'Using coordinate-based meta-analysis methods and independent review, 1,777 studies were returned from three databases. 38 studies investigating motor task learning met the inclusion criteria, were allocated as either online or offline learning based on their scanning placement, and revealed both unique and overlapping regional activation/deactivation patterns.'

 Our findings concur with those of previous meta-analyses investigating online motor learning, and find support for previous theories surrounding the networks involved in consolidation and offline processes in motor learning. Shared activation between online and offline motor learning was found in the supplemental motor area and somatosensory cortex, highlighting regions which are continually involved in both processes, and identifying those which may be differentially modulated to alter motor learning outcomes.
