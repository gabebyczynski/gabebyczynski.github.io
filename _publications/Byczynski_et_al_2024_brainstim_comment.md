excerpt: 'We caution that in absence of a sham or placebo-controlling groups or more direct mechanistic approaches, it is difficult to conclude that peripheral mechanisms are not at play based strictly on non-specific arousal.'

The recent work by Gebodh et al., titled: Frontal HD-tACS enhances behavioral and EEG biomarkers of vigilance in continuous attention task [1] is a welcomed and advancing study which furthered our understanding of how transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) might modulate vigilance behaviours and their associated physiological markers. In two successive experiments, they present findings which indicate that 30Hz HD-tACS delivered in a frontal montage, as opposed to motor montage, modulates behavioural and neurophysiological markers of vigilant attention, without associated somatic arousal (e.g., cardiovascular and sleepiness). These findings are important, and not without commendation, particularly for the publication of an impressive brain stimulation dataset which can be used to pursue novel, and reproducible, advances in the field of brain stimulation. We wish to comment, however, on the secondary claims of this paper, which state that despite behavioural and neurophysiological modulation, there is no evidence for a peripheral or transcutaneous mechanism.
