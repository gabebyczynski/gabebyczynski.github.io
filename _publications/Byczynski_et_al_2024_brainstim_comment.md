excerpt: 'We caution that in absence of a sham or placebo-controlling groups or more direct mechanistic approaches, it is difficult to conclude that peripheral mechanisms are not at play based strictly on non-specific arousal.'

We conclude that brief myofascial intervention supports other research in the field, finding that physical touch and massage techniques can alter cognition and perception. We posit further research to investigate its future use as an intervention for both physical and cognitive modulation. Importantly, we provide preliminary evidence that the neural processes that resonate with this type of massage involve complex feedforward and backward cortical pathways, of which a significant portion participate in modulating the visual perception of external stimuli.
