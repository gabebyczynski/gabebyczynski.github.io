In a novel approach, we review literature of motor learning modulation in terms of learning stage, categorizing learning into acquisition, consolidation, and retention. We endeavour to provide a current perspective on the stage-specific mechanism behind modulation of motor task learning, to give insight into how electrical stimulation improves or hinders motor learning, and how mechanisms differ depending on learning stage.
