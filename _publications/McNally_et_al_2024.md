Despite numerous reviews on the effects of tACS, and its role in motor learning, there are few studies which synthesize the numerous frequencies and their respective theoretical mechanisms as they relate to motor and perceptual processes. Here we provide a short overview of the main stimulation frequencies used in motor learning modulation (e.g., alpha, beta, and gamma), and discuss the effect and proposed mechanisms of these studies. We summarize with the current state of the field, the effectiveness and variability in motor learning modulation, and novel mechanistic proposals from other fields.
