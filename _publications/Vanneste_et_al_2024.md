To identify a secondary factor for tinnitus generation, we examined a unique dataset of individuals with intermittent chronic tinnitus, who experience fluctuating periods of tinnitus. EEGs of healthy controls were compared to EEGs of participants who reported perceiving tinnitus on certain days, but no tinnitus on other days.. The EEG data revealed that tinnitus onset is associated with increased theta activity in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and decreased theta functional connectivity between the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the auditory cortex.
