To provide context for the anatomical and functional aspects of tinnitus and its manifestation, this chapter discusses the anatomy and physiology of the auditory system. The approach begins at the ear, moving through the process of transduction, to peripheral nervous system components, and ending at the central nervous system regions of the auditory system. There is emphasis on the ascending and descending auditory systems, and their contributions to the development and etiology of tinnitus. In addition to anatomy, this section also discusses functional aspects of the auditory nervous system including a background of animal studies of auditory function, frequency selectivity, and neural connectivity. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how tinnitus may arise through the anatomical layout of the auditory nervous system. Diseases that arise from phantom sensations, the contribution of hidden hearing loss, and brain regions relating to tinnitus are discussed. This chapter fundamentally aims to provide sufficient anatomical and physiological of the auditory system background to allow the reader to better understand the structures and functions underlying tinnitus and its manifestation.
