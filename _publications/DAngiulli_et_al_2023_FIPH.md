Participants reported a 2-h sleep phase delay and SJL. Stroop
interference influenced accuracy on Monday and Wednesday similarly, with better
performance in the afternoon. For RTs, the afternoon advantage was much larger
on Monday than Wednesday. Midline Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) yielded
higher amplitudes and shorter latencies on Wednesday morning and Monday
afternoon, in time windows related to attention or response execution. A notable
exception were delayed ERP latencies on Wednesday afternoon. The latter could
be explained by the fact that delta EEG waves tended to be the most prominent,
suggesting heightened error monitoring due to accumulating mental fatigue.
