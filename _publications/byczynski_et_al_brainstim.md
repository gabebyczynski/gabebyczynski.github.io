excerpt: 'We chose to pursue a series of two experiments which investigate if attentional control can be modulated using NITESGON. Two pathways of modulation, either via top-down goal directed processes or bottom-up stimulus driven processes, could be selectively modulated via the peripheral nerve through subcortical activity.'

Novel approaches to modulating neural activity via peripheral nerve stimulation have been developed, including non-invasive stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (NITESGON). Using NITESGON, research has successfully modulated neural activity governing memory processes, with evidence toward a norepinephrine-driven mechanism through the Locus Coeruleus (LC-NE) [4]. Following this evidence, we chose to pursue a series of two experiments which investigate if attentional control can be modulated using NITESGON. Two pathways of modulation, either via top-down goal directed processes or bottom-up stimulus driven processes, could be selectively modulated via the peripheral nerve through subcortical activity.
